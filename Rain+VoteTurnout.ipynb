    "${\\beta1}$ represents the percent change in pctvote (percent change of registered voters who turn out to vote) associated with one unit increase in rain, while holding all other variables constant. Based on the situation, it is likely that less rain would result in higher voter turnout because people are more willing to go out when they don't risk getting wet. Conversely, heavy rain compared to light rain would likely discourage people from driving to the polling stations or dropping off their ballots. Therefore, if one unit of rain is associated with ${\\beta1}$, I expect ${\\beta1}$ to be a negative value, indicating that increased rainfall leads to a decrease in voter turnout.\n"
